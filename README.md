# Guessing-Game ft. RUST
This is a beginner guessing game using rust. This gives us the idea to grasp rust by 0.1% of overview. Most importanly we learned how to set up rust project along with cargo. The most efficient feature I must say!!  Rust being robust and hastle free, the dependencies helped to succesfully build this project.
